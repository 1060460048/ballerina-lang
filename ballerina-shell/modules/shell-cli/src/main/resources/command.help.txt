Ballerina Shell Help

Type a ballerina statement, expression or a declaration.

Imports should be done with prefixes and the modules
should be available in the classpath.
To see available imports use /imports.

Following commands are the in-built commands.

/exit           - Exit the terminal shell.

                  ballerina-by-example site.
