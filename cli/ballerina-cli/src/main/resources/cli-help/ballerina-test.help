NAME
       ballerina-test - Run package tests

SYNOPSIS
       bal test [<options>] [<ballerina-file-path> | <ballerina-package-path>]


DESCRIPTION
       Compile and execute Ballerina test sources and print a summary of
       the test results. You can execute tests in a Ballerina package or a standalone
       Ballerina file.
    
       Use 'bal test` to execute the tests in the current package.

       Use 'bal test <balfile>' to execute the given Ballerina test file.
              
       Note: Testing single `.bal` files, which belong to a Ballerina package is not allowed.
              
       The file path can be relative or absolute.


OPTIONS
       --offline
           When building a package, the remote repository (Ballerina Central) is
           always checked for the latest artifacts of the dependencies. If the
           '--offline' option is specified, this remote check is not done and
           the local artifacts will be used instead.

       --list-groups
           List the test groups available in the test files. Groups are
           tags that are added to the test functions. They are used to
           control the execution of the test functions by specifying a
           group or a set of groups that need to be executed in a test
           run. A test function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --groups <test_group, ...>
           Specify the test groups to be executed. Groups are tags that are
           added to the test functions. They are used to control the
           execution of the test functions by specifying a group or a set of
           groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test
           function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --disable-groups <test_group, ...>
           Specify the test groups to be excluded. Groups are tags that are
           added to the test functions. They are used to control the
           execution of the test functions by specifying a group or a set of
           groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test
           function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --tests <test_function_name, ...>
            Specify the test functions to be executed. A specific set of
            test functions can be executed using this command.

       --tests <PackageName>:<test_function_name, ...>
            Specify the test functions to be executed only from the default
            module. Wildcards can be used to specify the set of functions to be executed.

       --tests <PackageName>.<ModuleName>:<test_function_name, ...>
            Specify the test functions to be executed only from the given
            module. Wildcards can be used to specify the set of functions to be executed.

       --rerun-failed
            Execute only the previously-failed test cases in the package.

       --code-coverage
           Enable code coverage. This will analyze the line coverage of
           source `.bal` files in the Ballerina package and add a section
           to the testerina report with the code coverage details.
           This feature is not supported with single BAL file executions.

       --test-report
           Generate an HTML report containing the test results.

       --coverage-format
            Generate a coverage report in the specified format. Only the 'xml' value is allowed.

       --experimental
           Enable the experimental language features.

       --debug
           Run the tests in the remote debugging mode.

       --observability-included
           Include package observability in the executable.
